  title: Authorization API
  description: |
    Renews the OAuth access token after two hours or more of inactivity.
    If the application does not make any requests for two hours, the access token is inactivated. 
    In this inactive state, the access token is not valid for authorizing requests. It must be reactivated using 
    the Renew Access Token API. By default, the access token expires at midnight US Eastern time. 
    Once the token has expired, no further requests will be processed until the user logs in again and the 
    application secures a new access token.
